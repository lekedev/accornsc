            No matter what stage of their money journey your kids are on, Acorns Early is designed 
            to grow with them. Younger ones start off with chores, allowance, and interactive 
            learning courses. As they grow older, Acorns Early helps track their spending, budgeting, 
            saving, and more â€” all with support and guidance from you along the way.
